# Movie Recommender System
## Tools & Techniques used:
### Machine learning ,NLp techniqus like limitization,vectorization ,Python,librarys like Numpy pandas ,streamlit,sklearn ,pkl 

### used open source dataset available on kaggle for training and creating recommendation syatem ,dataset consists 5k movies information alongwith crew and cast 
### Project Flow

#### Downloaded dataset 
#### then load into jupyter.ntbk with help of pandas analyzed and found realted and useful columns from dataset there 2 diffrent datasets so need to merge that also some columns have string that which problimitc in start so convert into lists .

#### use content based filtering  use cosine similrity search technique to find nearst vectors 

#### After training model dump using pkl and after that create  user friendly streamlit app for quick deployment.
